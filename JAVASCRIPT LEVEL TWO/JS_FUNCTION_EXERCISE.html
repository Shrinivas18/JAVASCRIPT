      <p>PROBLEM 1: SLEEPING IN <br>

      Write a function called sleepIn that takes in two boolean parameters: weekday
      and vacation.<br>

       The parameter weekday is true if it is a weekday, and the parameter vacation is
       true if we are on vacation. We sleep in if it is not a weekday or
       we're on vacation. Return true if we sleep in.<br> So some example input and output:<br>

       sleepIn(false, false) → true <br>
       sleepIn(true, false) → false <br>
       sleepIn(false, true) → true <br><br>

       function sleepIn(weekday, vacation) {   } <br><br>


      </p>

      <p>PROBLEM 2: MONKEY TROUBLE <br>

       We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters aSmile and bSmile indicate if
       each is smiling. We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of
       them is smiling. Return true if we are in trouble. <br>

       Example Input and Output: <br>

      monkeyTrouble(true, true) → true <br>
      monkeyTrouble(false, false) → true <br>
      monkeyTrouble(true, false) → false <br><br>

      function monkeyTrouble(aSmile, bSmile) {  } <br><br>

      </p>

      <p>PROBLEM 3: STRING TIMES <br>

       Given a string and a non-negative int n, return a larger
       string that is n copies of the original string.<br>

       Example input and output:<br>

       stringTimes("Hi", 2) → "HiHi" <br>
       stringTimes("Hi", 3) → "HiHiHi" <br>
       stringTimes("Hi", 1) → "Hi" <br><br>

      function stringTimes(str, n) {    } <br><br>

      </p>PROBLEM 4: LUCKY SUM <br>

       Given 3 numerical values, a b c, return their sum. However, if one of the values is
       13 then it does not count towards the sum and values to its right do not count.
       So for example, if b is 13, then both b and c do not count. <br>

       Hint (Explore using multiple return statements inside a single function!) <br>

       Example input and output: <br>

       luckySum(1, 2, 3) → 6 <br>
       luckySum(1, 2, 13) → 3 <br>
       luckySum(1, 13, 3) → 1 <br><br>

      function luckySum(a, b, c){   } <br><br>

      <p>PROBLEM 5: <br>

       You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code to
       compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket,
       2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61
       and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2.
       Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases. <br>

       Here are some example inputs and outputs: <br>

       caught_speeding(60, false) → 0 <br>
       caught_speeding(65, false) → 1 <br>
       caught_speeding(65, true) → 0 <br><br>

      function caught_speeding(speed, is_birthday){   } <br><br>

      </p>BONUS: MAKE BRICKS <br>

       We want to make a row of bricks that is goal inches long. We have a number of
       small bricks (1 inch each) and big bricks (5 inches each). Return true if it
       is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks. This is a
       little harder than it looks and can be done without any loops in a single line! <br>

       If you can't figue this one out, don't worry, that's why its a bonus! <br>

       makeBricks(3, 1, 8) → true <br>
       makeBricks(3, 1, 9) → false <br>
       makeBricks(3, 2, 10) → true <br><br>

      function makeBricks(small, big, goal){   } <br><br>
